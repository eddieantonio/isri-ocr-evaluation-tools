# Install (OS X)

Using [Homebrew][brew]:

    brew tap eddieantonio/eddieantonio
    brew install isri-ocr-evaluation-tools

[brew]: http://brew.sh/

Building
========

To build the library and all of the programs, simply type `make`.

## Dependencies

 - [utf8proc](https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc)

### OS X

    brew install utf8proc

### Ubuntu/Debian

If this package is not in your package repository, follow "Other Linux"
below.

    sudo apt-get install libutf8proc-dev

### Other Linux

The automated way (copy-paste this one line):

    curl -fsSL http://www.eddieantonio.ca/isri-ocr-evaluation-tools/install_utf8proc.sh | sh

The manual way:

    curl -OL https://github.com/JuliaLang/utf8proc/archive/v1.3.1.tar.gz
    tar xzf v1.3.1.tar.gz
    cd utf8proc-1.3.1/
    make
    sudo make install
    # Rebuild the shared object cache - needed to load the library
    # at runtime <http://linux.die.net/man/8/ldconfig>
    sudo ldconfig
    cd -

## Building the tools

    make

## Installing globally

Install to `/usr/local/`:

    sudo make install
    
Note: You will not need `sudo` on OS X if you have `brew` installed.

## Installing "locally"

This will not copy any files at all, but instead create the appropriate
shell commands to add all executables, man pages, and libraries to
the correct path (replace `~/.bashrc` with your start-up file):

    make exports >> ~/.bashrc
